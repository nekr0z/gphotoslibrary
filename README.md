# gphotoslibrary
a Go library that (partially) implements Google Library API

This library was forked from Google's official autogenerated library, that has since been altogether removed from Google's repository. The original library was incomplete anyway.

The aim here is to have a complete (in future) library while maintaining backwards compatibility, so that any project could
```
import "github.com/nekr0z/gphotoslibrary"
```
instead of
```
import "google.golang.org/api/photoslibrary/v1"
```
that now points to nowhere and fails.
