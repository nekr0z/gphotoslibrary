# gphotoslibrary
a Go library that (partially) implements Google Library API

[![Build Status](https://github.com/nekr0z/gphotoslibrary/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://github.com/nekr0z/gphotoslibrary/actions/workflows/build.yml) [![codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/nekr0z/gphotoslibrary/branch/master/graph/badge.svg)](https://codecov.io/gh/nekr0z/gphotoslibrary) [![Go Report Card](https://goreportcard.com/badge/evgenykuznetsov.org/go/gphotoslibrary)](https://goreportcard.com/report/evgenykuznetsov.org/go/gphotoslibrary) [![GoDoc](https://godocs.io/evgenykuznetsov.org/go/gphotoslibrary?status.svg)](http://godocs.io/evgenykuznetsov.org/go/gphotoslibrary)

This library was forked from Google's official autogenerated library, that has since been altogether removed from Google's repository. The original library was incomplete anyway.

The aim here is to have a complete (in future) library while maintaining backwards compatibility, so that any project could
```
import "evgenykuznetsov.org/go/gphotoslibrary"
```
instead of
```
import "google.golang.org/api/photoslibrary/v1"
```
that now points to nowhere and fails.

## Development and Contribution
I try to fix bugs when I see them, but in general the library is being developed in a "scratch your own itch" way, that is, I add missing functionality when I need it. You are welcome to do so, too. Clone, fix, pull request - you know the drill. If you decide to do that, try to adhere to the general way Google API libraries are written: we want to keep this library familiar and in style with the rest of the bunch.
